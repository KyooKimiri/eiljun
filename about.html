This website is all about the essential parts and builds of computers. Whether you're new to computer hardware or looking to expand your knowledge, we cover the basic components that make up a computer system. From the central processing unit (CPU), which serves as the brain of the computer, to the motherboard, which connects everything together, you’ll find everything you need to know. We’ll also dive into memory (RAM), storage options like HDDs and SSDs, graphics cards (GPUs) for handling visuals, and the power supply unit (PSU) that keeps it all running. Our goal is to give you a comprehensive understanding of each part, so you can build, upgrade, or simply appreciate the technology behind computers.
