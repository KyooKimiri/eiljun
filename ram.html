        <h1>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h1>
        <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and machine code currently being used. RAM is a volatile memory, meaning it loses all stored information when power is turned off. It is essential for providing fast data access to the CPU.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Features of RAM</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> RAM requires a constant power supply to retain data, and all information is lost when the computer is turned off.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> RAM is much faster than other storage types like HDDs and SSDs, allowing quick access to data needed by the CPU.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can handle at once, which can improve multitasking and overall system performance.</li>
        </ul>
